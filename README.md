Endometriosis Diagnosis Analysis Using Python
-Identifying Key Factors Affecting Endometriosis Diagnosis

Project Overview:
Endometriosis is a chronic medical condition affecting 10% of women of reproductive age worldwide. 
This project analyzes a dataset of 10,000 patient records to identify key factors influencing endometriosis diagnosis.

Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and data visualization to uncover insights 
that can aid in early diagnosis and better treatment strategies.

Objective:
Analyze medical data to identify significant predictors of endometriosis diagnosis.
Use data visualization to highlight trends and correlations between features.
Identify key risk factors such as chronic pain levels, hormone abnormalities, and menstrual irregularity.

Dataset:
Size: 10,000 patient records
Features:
Age
Menstrual Irregularity (0 = Regular, 1 = Irregular)
Chronic Pain Level (Scale: 0-10)
Hormone Level Abnormality (0 = Normal, 1 = Abnormal)
Infertility (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
BMI
Diagnosis (0 = No Endometriosis, 1 = Endometriosis)

Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Analysis, Data Visualization

Key Insights & Findings:
Hormone Level Abnormality and Chronic Pain Level were the strongest indicators of an endometriosis diagnosis.
BMI and Menstrual Irregularity had weaker correlations and were not strong predictors.
The dataset was clean (no missing values or duplicates).
Outliers were detected in BMI, but they appeared to be valid medical cases.
Most cases occurred within a specific age range, but age alone wasnâ€™t a strong predictor.
